# myGHG: A Way To Play With Carbon Offsetting

The idea:

 * Shiny UI to:
   - record trips made (with mode)
   - record trips avoided via skype/zoom/some other means, even POTS!
 * use of someone's API to calculate CO2 emitted/saved per trip
 * visualise in some way
 * provoke discussion of whether trips avoided is a form of offsetting (or not)
